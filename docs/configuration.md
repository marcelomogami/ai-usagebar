# Configuration reference

The config file is `~/.config/ai-usagebar/config.toml`. All fields are optional.
Claude, Codex, Z.AI, and OpenRouter are enabled by default; other providers are
opt-in. The commented example shows the defaults and provider-specific
settings.

Both binaries accept `--config <PATH>` to use an alternate file instead of the
default location (`%APPDATA%\ai-usagebar\config.toml` on Windows). The file
must already exist; loads and the Settings overlay then read and write that
file for the whole process, so a test config never touches the real one:

```bash
ai-usagebar --vendor kimi --config ./config.test.toml --watch 5
ai-usagebar-tui --config ./config.test.toml
```

```toml

# is selected when the TUI opens. Defaults to anthropic when not set.

`[openrouter]` key remains the default account and needs no migration.

### Balance tanks

DeepSeek, Kilo, Novita, Moonshot and prepaid Grok report how much money is
**left** and nothing else. There is no denominator in those responses, so
there is nothing to draw a meter against and the row is a plain balance.

`display_limit` supplies that denominator yourself — the size of the tank, in
the currency that vendor already reports:

```toml
[deepseek]
display_limit = 200        # you topped up $200 and want to watch it burn down
```

It must be finite and greater than zero; anything else fails at load with the
offending section named. There is no default and no built-in figure: leave it
out and nothing changes.

It is a fallback, never an override: a vendor that states a limit of its own
keeps it. That is why **`[openrouter]` has no `display_limit` at all**. It
reports credits purchased against credits used (and a per-key limit when the key
has one), so there is nothing to fall back to — and in the one case where a tank
would not simply be ignored, a free-tier account that purchased nothing,
honouring it would be actively wrong: that row's percentage comes from the API,
not from the tank, so the bar would read `0%` for an account with money in it.
A free-tier OpenRouter account therefore keeps its dollar figure on the bar even
at the `"percent"` default. `[openrouter]` does take `headline`.

The Anthropic Admin API's `monthly_limit` is a separate, older setting and is
unaffected.

The percentage is **consumed**, matching every other meter in the app:

```
(display_limit - balance) / display_limit, clamped to 0–100
```

A balance above the cap reads as 0% used; the money figure is what says how far
above it sits.

`headline` is a separate choice: which of the two numbers goes on the bar.

| value       | bar        | detail line |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `"amount"`  | `$50.00`   | `75% of $200.00 used ($50.00 left)` |
| `"percent"` | `75%`      | `$50.00 of $200.00 left (75% used)` |

Balance vendors default to `"amount"`; `[openrouter]`, which always has a
denominator of its own, defaults to `"percent"`. Setting `display_limit` does
not switch the headline by itself, and choosing `"percent"` with no limit from
either source leaves the amount on the bar rather than inventing a percentage.

The Omarchy panel, the KDE plasmoid and the tray popover (Windows and macOS)
read the metric's own `headline` field out of `usage --json` rather than
guessing from the row's label. In the popover, `"amount"` puts the money figure
under the meter and moves the percentage and the detail line to its hover text;
`"percent"` keeps the popover's used/left toggle. Waybar and GNOME build their
bar text from the per-vendor formats, so `headline` does not reach them.

### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot uses the OAuth login managed by the official GitHub CLI. Run
`gh auth login --web`, then select **GitHub Copilot** under **Primary Provider**
in the Omarchy settings form and save; this enables `[copilot]` and sets it as
the primary provider. The normal fetch path runs only the fixed structured
command `gh auth token`. ai-usagebar never parses GitHub CLI configuration or
credential stores and never writes the OAuth token to its config or cache.

`GITHUB_COPILOT_TOKEN` is an optional explicit environment override. It takes
precedence over `gh auth token`, which can be useful for a managed runtime that
provides its own short-lived token. Do not put that token in `config.toml`.

For more than one Codex login, add `[[openai.accounts]]` — a label and that
login's own `auth.json`, the same shape `[[anthropic.accounts]]` uses:

```toml
[[openai.accounts]]
label = "work"
codex_auth_path = "~/.config/ai-usagebar/accounts/work-codex/auth.json"
```

Create the second login with `CODEX_HOME=~/.codex-work codex login` and point
`codex_auth_path` at the file it writes. Select it with `--account work`; each
account caches separately under `~/.cache/ai-usagebar/openai/<label>`. The
singular `codex_auth_path` remains the default account and needs no migration.

### Explicitly enable a provider

Run `ai-usagebar settings enable anthropic` to set `[anthropic].enabled = true`,
including when it was explicitly false. This is an explicit opt-in; automatic
detection continues to respect disabled providers. The command preserves other
settings, comments, and credentials, and supports `--config PATH` to edit an
existing alternate configuration. It does not sign in or select a primary
provider. Successful writes return `{"ok":true}`; failures exit nonzero.
